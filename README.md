# Telecom Churn Analysis Case Study

## Project Description

This project analyzes telecom churn data to understand the factors that contribute to customer churn. By identifying these factors, the telecom company can take proactive measures to retain customers and reduce churn rates. The project uses a dataset containing customer demographics, service usage, and churn status to build a model that predicts the likelihood of churn.

## Steps

1.  **Data Exploration:** Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of features and identify potential patterns related to churn.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values, and transform categorical features into numerical representations.
3.  **Feature Engineering:** Create new features that may improve the predictive power of the model.
4.  **Model Building:** Train a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on the preprocessed data and engineered features.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Results and Insights:** Summarize the findings of the analysis and identify the key factors contributing to customer churn.
7. **Reporting**: Deliver a clear and concise report that provides information about findings, methodology, and results.

## Next Steps

1.  **Model Improvement:** Explore other machine learning models and hyperparameter tuning to improve prediction accuracy.
2.  **Further Analysis:** Conduct a more in-depth analysis of specific customer segments to tailor retention strategies.
3. **Implementation:** Develop a system to implement the model for proactive customer retention.
